# grapher

A simple tool for graphing functions. Grapher is built with React, it uses [expr-eval](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval) for parsing strings into mathematic expressions, and [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) for plotting.

A live version of the app can be found [here](https://zam-5.github.io)
